                <dt>	Due to its process-based model, Apache can consume a significant amount of memory and CPU resources when handling multiple connections. Each request requires its own process or thread, leading to overhead.
                    	Under high load, this can result in slower performance and potential server bottlenecks.
                </dt>
        </dl>
            <dd>Nginx webserver</dd>
                <dt>	Nginxâ€™s event-driven architecture allows it to handle many concurrent connections with minimal resource usage. It can serve static files and handle requests without creating new processes for each connection.
                    	This leads to better performance and responsiveness, especially under high traffic conditions.
